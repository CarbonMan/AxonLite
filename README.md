# Axon Lite

A Chrome extension for sending Stellar Lumens to site users or owners.

Currently only works with Reddit though more implementations are on their way.

## Installation
* The first step is to download the extension from this repository page. 

* Click the “Clone or download” button (upper right on this screen) and then click “Download ZIP”

![Download](https://rawgithub.com/CarbonMan/AxonLite/master/screen.png "Download the zip")

* Take the downloaded ZIP file and extract it. We need to give it a permanent home because Chrome will externally load the files (if they get moved/deleted then the extension will stop working).

* With the extension downloaded and extracted, we can now install it. In Chrome, navigate to chrome://extensions

* Click the "Load unpacked extension..." button and select the directory holding the AxonLite extension.
