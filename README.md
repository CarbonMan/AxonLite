# Stellar Tips

A Chrome extension for sending Lumens tips to site users

Currently only works with Reddit though more are on their way.

## Reddit
TL;DR
There are 2 videos the 1st shows how to associate a Reddit user with a Stellar address. The second shows how to use it to make micro-payments to Reddit users. It is not pretty but it built that way so that it is safe for crypto, and that is the main point for now.
